        <!--steps  -->
        <ol> 
            <li> Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and 
                half and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. 
                Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, 
                so consistency will be on the thinner side. </li>

            <li> Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable 
                oil to a large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes. </li>
            
            <li> Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat 
                with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake. 
                Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave 
                small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on 
                the other side, about 2 minutes more. </li>

            <li>Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of 
                whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon. </li> 
        </ol>
