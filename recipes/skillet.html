        <strong> <h1> Steps:  </h1></strong>

        <ol> 
            <!-- step 1 -->
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <!-- step2 -->
            <li> Place bacon in a 10-inch skillet and cook over medium heat, 
                stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a 
                slotted spoon to remove bacon to a paper towel-lined small bowl. 
                Discard 1/2 of the bacon fat using a spoon. </li>
            <!-- step 3 -->
            <li> Cook sausage in remaining bacon fat in the hot skillet until 
                browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to the bowl with 
                bacon.</li>    
            <!-- step 4 -->
            <li> Heat canola oil and butter in the same skillet over medium heat. 
                Add hash browns and onion. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, onion 
                powder, salt, and black pepper. Spread hash brown mixture evenly in 
                the skillet; cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn 
                hash browns over and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <!-- step 5 -->
            <li> Whisk together eggs, milk, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder in
                 a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over 
                 cheese-covered hash browns in the skillet. Sprinkle the top with bacon
                  and sausage pieces. </li>
            <!-- step 6 -->
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the top is puffed, cheese is melted, and 
                a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
